## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Training

Example configurations can be found in the `configs` directory. To run a training job, use the following command:

```bash
accelerate launch scripts/training/training.py scripts/configs/examples/modernbert.yaml
```

## Inference

To run inference with a contextual model, you can use the following examples:
```python
from contextual_embeddings import LongContextEmbeddingModel
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from pylate.models import ColBERT

documents = [
    [
        "The old lighthouse keeper trimmed his lamp, its beam cutting a lonely path through the fog.",
        "He remembered nights of violent storms, when the ocean seemed to swallow the sky whole.",
        "Still, he found comfort in his duty, a silent guardian against the treacherous sea."
    ],
    [
        "A curious fox cub, all rust and wonder, ventured out from its den for the first time.",
        "Each rustle of leaves, every chirping bird, was a new symphony to its tiny ears.",
        "Under the watchful eye of its mother, it began to learn the secrets of the whispering forest."
    ]
]

# ============================== AVERAGE POOLING EXAMPLE ==============================

base_model = SentenceTransformer("nomic-ai/modernbert-embed-base")
contextual_model = LongContextEmbeddingModel(
    base_model=base_model,
    add_prefix=True
)
embeddings = contextual_model.embed_documents(documents)
print("Length of embeddings:", len(embeddings)) # 2
print("Length of first document embedding:", len(embeddings[0])) # 3
print(f"Shape of first chunk embedding: {embeddings[0][0].shape}") # torch.Size([768])

# ============================== LATE INTERACTION (COLBERT) EXAMPLE ==============================

base_model = ColBERT("lightonai/GTE-ModernColBERT-v1")
contextual_model = LongContextEmbeddingModel(
    base_model=base_model,
    pooling_mode="tokens"
)
embeddings = contextual_model.embed_documents(documents)
print("Length of embeddings:", len(embeddings)) # 2
print("Length of first document embedding:", len(embeddings[0])) # 3
print(f"Shape of first chunk embedding: {embeddings[0][0].shape}") # torch.Size([22, 128])
```

## Evaluation

Code for evaluation can be found in the [ConTEB](https://github.com/illuin-tech/conteb) repository.


### Abstract

A limitation of modern document retrieval embedding methods is that they typically encode passages (chunks) from the same documents independently, often overlooking crucial contextual information from the rest of the document that could greatly improve individual chunk representations.

In this work, we introduce *ConTEB* (Context-aware Text Embedding Benchmark), a benchmark designed to evaluate retrieval models on their ability to leverage document-wide context. Our results show that state-of-the-art embedding models struggle in retrieval scenarios where context is required. To address this limitation, we propose *InSeNT* (In-sequence Negative Training), a novel contrastive post-training approach which combined with \textit{late chunking} pooling enhances contextual representation learning while preserving computational efficiency. Our method significantly improves retrieval quality on *ConTEB* without sacrificing base model performance. 
We further find chunks embedded with our method are more robust to suboptimal chunking strategies and larger retrieval corpus sizes.
We open-source all artifacts here and at https://github.com/illuin-tech/contextual-embeddings.
